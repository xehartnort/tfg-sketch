'''
Long period (> 2 Ã— 10^18 ) random number generator of Lâ€™Ecuyer with Bays-Durham shuffle
and added safeguards. Returns a uniform random deviate between 0.0 and 1.0 (exclusive of
the endpoint values). Call with idum a negative integer to initialize; thereafter, do not alter
idum between successive deviates in a sequence. RNMX should approximate the largest floating
value that is less than 1.
